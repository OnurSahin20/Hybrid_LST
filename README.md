# Hybrid_LST
Hybrid_LST is a new initiative to visualize, manipulate, and hybridize satellite-based Land Surface Temperature Data. 
Version 0.1 supports downloading Sentinel 3A L2 LST products and categorizes data with time and Orbit Direction (Descending, Ascending). Afterward, the code automatically extracts NetCDF files from the zip for parent (time) and child (Orbit Direction) folders.
